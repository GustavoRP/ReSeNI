OneRF
-----
OneRF is a startup that aims to create low-cost and scalable M2M connectivity solutions suitable to Brazilian market for SmartGrid, Smart City and Industry.

We have developed a RF Mesh network based on industry-standard technologies defined by workgroups such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
The RF Mesh network is automatically created as new Radio Modules are added / removed and it is capable of self-healing.
Each Radio Module (oneRF_NIC) has a unique IPv6. The use of IPv6 protocol with IEEE 802.15.4g allows seamless integration of the Radio Modules with the current IT infrastructure.
